<p><b>information(funFacts);</b></p>
<p> > The Möbius Strip is named after a symbol of the same name. This symbol represents infinity, and in some cases immortality.</p>
<p> > The design of Lawrence is based of the guy from the "that's how the mafia works" meme, Jovan is based off of Nicolas Cage, Robert is based off of Terry Hintz from LISA: The Painful, Samantha is based off of Manah from Drakengard, and Stallone... is based off of nothing. He's special that way.</p>		   
<p> > The name "Earl Celvar" comes from the color earl, which is grey, and his last name comes from a very poorly spelled silver.</p>
<p> > The text segments are inspired by the segments of NieR: Gestalt/RepliCant and NieR: Automata.</p>
<p> > The title screen and game icon is an infinity sign with a face. The right ring was at first an eyeball, but due to filters it became a blob and was never fixed.</p>
